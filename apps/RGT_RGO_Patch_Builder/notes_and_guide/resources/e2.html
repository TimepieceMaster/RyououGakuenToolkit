	The name of the episode itself is based on the<br>
	1999 visual novel "Comic Party", a game about the<br>
	production and selling of doujinshi at conventions.<br>
	As you'll see in the Episode 2 patch,<br>
	the selling of doujinshi ends up playing a<br>
	significant role in Comic Festival's story as well.

	In the intro scene, this line from Kagami is in reference<br>
	to the famous line from Konata where she says that a<br>
	"A flat chest is a status symbol. They're extremely rare."
	</p>
	<img src="e2/status_symbol_ls_manga.png"></img>
	<p>
	The game she is quoting in that panel is the 2004 visual novel "Shuffle!".<br>
	Specifically the character Mayumi Thyme, who takes a lot of pride in her small bust.
	</p>
	<img src="e2/status_symbol_shuffle.png"><img>
	<p>
	As an additional fun fact, Ryouou Gakuen Outousai was originally supposed<br>
	to have a costume for one of the characters inspired by Mayumi Thyme,<br>
	as her name appears within an image in the game's files that's used to display<br>
	the names of the costumes in the profile menu.<br>
	However, no such costume is present in the final game or in the game's files.<br>
	</p>
	<img src="e2/mayumi_thyme_costume.png"></img>
	<p>
	Seen above is the image containing some of the graphics used in the profile menu.<br>
	Highlighted is Mayumi Thyme's name written in Japanese, which is placed amongst<br>
	the graphics for the names of the other costumes in the game.

	In the intro scene, Kagami's cover-up that she was reviewing<br>
	what she learned in world history class has her quoting the famous<br>
	line from William Shakespeare's play "Julius Caesar".<br>
	Spoken by the titular character and real life Roman Dictator,<br>
	Julius Caesar, he says this during his assassination upon<br>
	recognizing that his friend, Marcus Junius Brutus, had betrayed him.

	<p>
	A reference that gets lost in translation. In the intro scene,<br>
	when Kagami and Tsukasa are trying to make sense of the writing<br>
	on the paper they found on the ground, one of the terms that confuses<br>
	them is "pillar power", and they don't end up figuring out what it's<br>
	supposed to mean.<br>
	However, the Japanese word used is "注力" (chuuriki), which while "pillar power"<br>
	is how you would translate it and is what you might understand it to be if you<br>
	read it literally, this is likely in reference to the "jinchuuriki" (人注力).<br>
	Jinchuuriki are a class of characters in the "Naruto" series who have tailed beasts<br>
	sealed within them, with Naruto himself being the most notable of these characters.

	<p>
	In the intro scene, these two lines are in reference to<br>
	the light novel series "Baka to Test to Shoukanjyuu", which translates<br>
	in English to "Idiots, Tests, and Summoned Beasts", though is usually<br>
    referred to as just "Baka and Test".
	</p>
	<p>
	The "femboy" Konata is referring to is "Baka and Test" character<br>
	Hideyoshi Kinoshita, a male character who has a very feminine appearance.<br>
	Notably, Hideyoshi is voiced by Emiri Katou in the anime adaptation,<br>
	the same voice actress that voices Kagami.<br>
	This is likely the reason Konata references Hideyoshi specifically.

	In the second intro scene, this "robot cat from the future"<br>
	the protagonist is referring to is the famous children's anime character<br>
	"Doraemon". Being from the 22nd century, he is able to procure a variety<br>
	of different gadgets capable of all sorts of incredible things, thus why<br>
	the protagonist thinks only with his help could he make time stop.

	<p>
	In the second intro scene, following the above "Doraemon" reference,<br>
	the protagonist blames his lateness on Doraemon's voice being changed.<br>
	This is in reference to the fact that Nobuyo Oyama, who had voiced Doraemon<br>
	since 1979, retired from the role in 2005, to the disappointment of many who<br>
	loved her performance.
	</p>
	<p>
	Nobuyo Oyama was also known for being a fan of the arcade game "Arkanoid",<br>
	and was able to clear the game while spending only a single coin.

	This sequence with Nanako during the scene where the protagonist<br>
	ends up in the school infirmary is a reference to the opening narration<br>

	This line from Yui during the infirmary scene if the protagonist chooses<br>
	to tell her to arrest Nanako is in reference to a line from the 1998 film<br>
	"Bayside Shakedown", based on the 1997 TV drama of the same name.<br>
	This line comes from a moment in the film where protagonist Shunsaku Aoshima<br>
	snaps at his superiors saying "incidents don't happen in the conference room, they happen on the scene!".
	</p>
	The moment from the film the line comes from can be seen here at 0:35<br>

	<img src="e2/dondake_rgo.png"></img>
	<p>
	Tsukasa's catchphrase of "dondake!" seen during the lunch scene on the first day is derived from<br>
	the Japanese word "doredake", meaning "how much?". However, it was mostly just used by high school girls<br>
	as an exclamation of surprise and doesn't necessarily mean the person is asking "how much?".<br>
	The catchphrase originates from Japanese make-up artist "Ikko", but also<br>
	was popularized from its appearance in the anime "Gintama", where it's also used as just a silly exclamation.<br>
