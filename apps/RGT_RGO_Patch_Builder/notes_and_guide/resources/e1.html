	"Panther Blizzard", that game released in December of 2011, which comes after<br>

	This exchange when running into the Hiiragi twins on the way to school on the first day<br>
	can be a bit confusing if you don't understand the form of Japanese comedy knows as "manzai".<br>
	In this kind of comedy routine, the humor primarily revolves around a duo consisting of<br>
	the "funny man"	role, also known as the "boke", who talks and acts in a ridiculous way,<br>
	and the "straight man" role, also known as the "tsukkomi", who reacts to the funny man<br>
	with great incredulity.
	</p>
	<p>
	Having just met the Hiiragi twins, the protagonist sees Kagami being more uptight and aggressive<br>
	and so acts like the "straight man" in a manzai duo. The protagonist then appears to view<br>
	Tsukasa's comment as being a bit dopey as it's stating the obvious and thus concludes<br>
	that she complements Kagami by playing the "funny man" role.

	"Devices" are a type of weapon used in the Nanoha series with Intelligent Devices being ones that<br>

	This line of Konata talking about how to get the protagonist<br>
	to be okay with doing the kiss scene for the play is in reference<br>
	to a poem taught to Japanese children about the three different approaches<br>
	taken by Japan's three great Daimyo, illustrated by three different responses<br>
	to a cuckoo not singing:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>"If the cuckoo does not sing, kill it" (Oda Nobunaga)</li>
	<li>"If the cuckoo does not sing, coax it" (Toyotomi Hideyoshi)</li>
	<li>"If the cuckoo does not sing, wait for it" (Tokugawa Ieyasu)</li>

	During the first lunch scene of the Konata route, the option to pick "30 points"<br>
	as an option for what the protagonist thinks of Konata's bento is a reference<br>
	to a scene from Episode 9 of the anime "Oishinbou". In it, the protagonist Shirou Yamaoka, a harsh food critic,<br>

	<p>

	<p>
	This gets a bit into speculation territory, but you may recall<br>
	that earlier in the Episode, the kiss scene of the "Fate/stay night"<br>
	play is referred to as "the night scene", which does not seem to line up<br>
	very well with the scenes from Fate that inspire the moments leading into<br>
	the kiss as seen in the play. Furthermore, there is no kiss in either scene<br>
	of the original source material.
	</p>
	<p>
	This may be because the kiss scene may actually be its own separate scene<br>
	and may be an adaptation of the fact that the original release of<br>
	"Fate/stay night" has sex scenes (not linked here due to its NSFW nature),<br>
	which do indeed take place at night.<br>
	The kiss then serves as an age-appropriate way of representing the initation<br>
	of the sex, of which the rest of the scene is obviously only implied but not shown.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	With that said, it doesn't seem that the kiss scene is an adaptation of any specific<br>
	sex scene within Fate.
	</p>
	<p>
	This interpretation helps to explain the above lines, but it is possible<br>
	I could be wrong and the kiss is meant to be nothing more than an addition<br>
	to the ending scenes from Fate mentioned above.

	Seen in Tsukasa's mini scenario, ema are small wooden plaques on which prayers<br>
	or requests are written and then hung up at Shinto shrines.<br>
	The word "ema" means "wooden horse" as these plaques are an evolution of horses<br>
	historically being donated to shrines.
	</p>
	<p>
	The kanji characters written on the ema above are 願, which is the kanji meaning<br>
	"request" and 祈, which is the kanji meaning "prayer".
	</p>
	<p>
	In otaku culture, it's common to draw pictures of anime characters on ema,<br>
	with Washinomiya Shrine, the real life shrine off which the Hiiragi's<br>
	Takanomiya Shrine is based, being no exception. These kinds of ema<br>
	are affectionately known as "ita ema" (literally "painful ema").

	Seen in Tsukasa's mini scenario, these otaku visiting Takanomiya Shrine<br>
	are in reference to how many fans of Lucky Star regularly visit the real life<br>
	Washinomiya Shrine that Takanomiya Shrine is based on due to their love for the series.<br>
	Visiting the real life places featured in anime and manga are affectionately<br>
	compared to religious pilgrimages, with these locations jokingly referred to as sacred grounds.

	Interestingly, notice that "Tsubasa" is not entirely a re-color of Tsukasa<br>
	as she has a long ponytail that Tsukasa does not have.

	Though Lucky Star: Ryouou Gakuen Outousai was developed largely independently of the Lucky Star anime,<br>
	the above scene from the anime managed to gain popularity so quickly that it was able to make<br>
